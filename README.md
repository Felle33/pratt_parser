# Pratt parser
Implementation in C of a Pratt parser for expression. This project takes inspiration from the following [link](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html), it is just an implementation of it in C using a slightly more complicated lexer (tlex)
and an arena allocator.
